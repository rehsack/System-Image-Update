    use System::Image::Update;

    System::Image::Update->new_with_options;

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 status

Lazy string contains the action to be executed next. Reasonably contains one of

=back

To force a specific action, create a new object with an initializer for scan, eg.

    use System::Image::Update;

    System::Image::Update->new_with_options(status => "download");

or from outside:

    sed -e 's/{$/{"status": "check",/' /etc/sysimg_update.json
    svc -t /etc/daemontools/services/sysimg_update

has status => (
    is        => "rw",
    lazy      => 1,
    builder   => 1,
    predicate => 1,
    isa       => sub { __PACKAGE__->can($_[0]) or die "Invalid status: $_[0]" }
);

sub _build_status
{
    my $self   = shift;
    my $status = "scan";

    -f $self->update_manifest and $status = "check";

=head1 METHODS

=head2 run

starts the main loop after it initiates status build in case of guessing status.

=cut

sub run
{
    my $self = shift;
    my $cb   = $self->status;
    # that starts the regular scan interval
    $cb ne "scan" and $self->wakeup_in(1, "scan");
    $self->wakeup_in(10, $cb);
    $self->loop->run;
}

=head2 collect_savable_config

routine being called when config saving is wanted

=cut

sub collect_savable_config
{
    my $self           = shift;
    my %savable_config = ();
    \%savable_config;
}

=head2 reset_config

routine being called to start fresh

=cut

sub reset_config
{
    my ($self, $status) = @_;
    $status or $self->schedule_scan;
    $self->wakeup_in(1, "save_config");
    $status and $self->wakeup_in(1, $status);
}

has savable_configfile => (is => "lazy");

sub _build_savable_configfile
{
    my $self = $_[0];
    my ($scfd) = system_image_update_dir;
    defined $scfd and -d $scfd and return File::Spec->catfile($scfd, basename($self->config_files->[0]));
    $self->config_files->[0];
}

=head2 save_config

Saves result of L</collect_savable_config> in first file got via
L<MooX::ConfigFromFile|MooX::ConfigFromFile::Role/config_files>.

=cut

sub save_config
{
    my $self           = shift;
    my $savable_config = $self->collect_savable_config;
    my $savable_text   = JSON->new->pretty->allow_nonref->encode($savable_config);
    my $target         = $self->savable_configfile;
    write_text($target, $savable_text);    # XXX prove utf8 stuff
